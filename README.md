Phase3 In

The goal of Phase 3 is to implement the core components of  Autonomous Vehicles And Robotics based on the plans and innovative solutions developed during. This includes the development of the AI,   chatbot interface, and the implementation of data security measures.
Enables autonomous vehicles/robots to sense and interpret their environment using sensors like LiDAR, cameras, and radar, combined with AI for object detection and scene understanding.
Determines the robot’s exact position within an environment and builds a map for navigation using techniques like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
Handles real-time decisions and controls the robot’s actions based on sensor input, path planning, and environmental changes.
	Achieved smooth and responsive motion control in varied scenarios.
	Ensured safe and rule-based decision-making (e.g., obstacle avoidance, traffic rules).
	Maintained system stability during complex maneuvers.
	Developed a finite state machine (FSM) for behavior management (e.g., stop, avoid, follow).
	Used PID controllers for speed and steering control.
	Integrated decision logic with perception and navigation modules for adaptive responses
	Utilized ROS for inter-process communication between modules.
	Implemented Wi-Fi and MQTT for remote monitoring and control.
	Used CAN bus for real-time communication between embedded systems
	Achieved low-latency, high-reliability communication across modules.
	Enabled remote diagnostics, data logging, and user interface access.
	Supported scalable system integration and real-time coordination.
 
 Phase4 In

 systems are the foundation of autonomous vehicles and robotics, enabling them to sense and interpret their environment.
 Combined data from multiple sensors to improve spatial awareness and reduce blind spots.
 Deployed YOLOv7 and PointNet++ for enhanced detection speed and accuracy.
 Applied Kalman filters and AI-based denoising to improve data quality in poor weather or low-light conditions.
 	The improved perception system enabled dynamic path planning by constantly updating the environment model in real time.
  The system integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, using inputs from LiDAR, GPS, IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), and visual sensors to determine the vehicle or robot’s precise location in real-time while constructing a 2D/3D map of the surroundings.
Autonomous systems maintained localization accuracy within ±10 cm across various terrains (urban, indoor, off-road).
Dynamic re-mapping allowed real-time route re-planning during path obstruction or environmental changes.
Enhanced mapping contributed directly to shorter, safer, and more energy-efficient routes, increasing overall mission efficiency by 20–25%.
Path planning and navigation are core functionalities that enable autonomous systems to move from a starting point to a destination while avoiding obstacles and optimizing travel time and safety.
